# KG-Development

KG-Development is a group by 2 students, who love to program and develop applications for many different use-cases.

A project you can look up is:
https://liste-aktive-gemeinde.eu-4.evennode.com/

Note: The real project behind this fairly simple webpage was the 'ArticleBuilder', a replica of Wordpress. Or in other words an browser in-built editor for articles, pages etc. A simplified version of the editor can be seen at the repository. The version for the repository is simplified and lacks many features, as the backend and the exact requests have to remain private as wished by the owner of the page. 

Other projects can be viewed in the repository section.
