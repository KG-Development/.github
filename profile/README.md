# WebXIO

WebXIO is a group by 2 students, who love to program and develop applications for many different use-cases.

Some online available projects you can look up:

 - https://a2pd.htlpinkafeld.app/ -> The Webinterface for the live-tracking of a rocket, flying in October, developed by us
   * -> a fully self-written SPA
 - https://www.aktive-gemeinde.at -> The Website of a party 
 - https://kgdevelopment-articlebuilder.netlify.app/  -> The Article Builder (a simplified version) of the pary, used to edit in browser articles

The article builder version for the repository is simplified and lacks many features, as the backend and the exact requests have to remain private as wished by the owner of the page.
Other projects can be viewed in the repository section if the permission was given by the one's, ordering the product.

Our website is deployed!!! https://webxio.at
